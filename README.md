# Web-Mobile-Spring-2022

This repo is a place where source code and documentation can be added for CSEE-5590-003. 



Every week we would have In Class Programming (ICP) assignments where we would apply things we have learned in class. This repo contains these ICP assignments.


Description of this course:
This course teaches students how web
technologies (Part 1) and mobile technologies (Part 2) work and how to apply them to applications.
Students will build applied programming skills using case studies for web and mobile applications
(using web services for recognition and analysis of image, speech, sensor, social network trends,
etc.).
• Part 1 (Week 1 - 8): Programming for Web App for Web application using
HTML/CSS/JavaScript/ReachJS & MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js).
We will also introduce React.
• Part 2 (Week 9 - 16): Programming for Mobile App (Android OS & React Native) to learn the
foundations of mobile platforms and techniques. Understand how to build a mobile
application using knowledge APIs (speech recognition, object recognition, GPS/map,
movement recognition, etc.), and learn how to lead successful mobile application projects.
Mobile applications will build using Java programming with Android Studio and SDK Tools.
